# Guess-My-Word Project

Guess-My-Word is a fun little game for users to test their vocabulary bank by guessing a 5-letter word, which is different for each round. The catch is that you only get 6 attempts to guess the word of the day, which is always a 5-letter word. Donâ€™t worry, there will be clues for you to know how close each of your guess is! The objective of the game is to guess the word right with under the least amount of attempts as possible.
